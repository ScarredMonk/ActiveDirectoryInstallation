# ActiveDirectoryInstallation
Active Directory Installation Script

This powershell script requires two arguments as follows:

Domain
DSRM password

Once these arguments are passed, itâ€™ll take few minutes and the forest will be installed and a reboot will reflect the changes automatically.

### Usage: 
. .\Install-AD.ps1
Invoke-ADForest -DomainName rootdse.org
Enter Safe Mode Admin Password and it will take care of the installation process.
